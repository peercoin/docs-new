# Burned and Fixed Fees
Peercoin's fees are fixed at 0.01 PPC per kB and are naturally burned with each transaction. The ease of provably burning coins is in contrast to many Proof-of-Work coins that recycle their transaction fees to miners in order to prepare for deflationary economies. Recycling fees back to block producers results in a 'fee market' that is inefficient and burdensome to the user experience. Peercon's economics allow for decentralized burning of a fixed fee when using the common resource of the Peercoin blockchain. As a result, block size limitations that plague other cryptocurrencies are not relevant to Peercoin. While the block size in Peercoin is set at 1 MB to protect against attacks, the community has been clear that higher blocksizes would be welcomed if the enhanced throughput were needed. As of writing, the Peercoin blockchain is very small (~1GB) and the fees are very low (~$0.005/txn), due in large part to the burned fixed-fee approach.

Peercoin block producers are motivated to include transactions in a block because the reduction in supply from burning fees increases the relative value of their stake. Proof-of-Work has inherent issues with this concept because every bit of computation resource is needed to find a block, so addition of transactions must be motivated by recycled fees. In Proof-of-Stake, the computation required in order to mint is minimal such that including transactions comes at practically no cost to the block producer.
