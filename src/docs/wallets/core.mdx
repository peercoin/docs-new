# Wallets

## Official client implementation

Once you install official Peercoin client from peercoin.net, youâ€™ll have access to three executables: peercoind, peercoin-qt, and peercoin-cli.

### Peercoin Wallet

`peercoin-qt` provides a combination full Peercoin network client and wallet. Peercoin-qt is highly portable application written in QT5 framework.
From the Help menu, you can access a console where you can enter the RPC commands so power-user features are still available.

### peercoind

`peercoind` provides a full peer which you can interact with through JSON-RPC interface on port 9902 (9904 for testnet).

### peercoin-cli

`peercoin-cli` allows you to send JSON-RPC commands to running instance of `peercoind` from the command line.
For example:
> peercoin-cli help

> peercoin-cli getinfo

All three programs get settings from peercoin.conf in the Peercoin application directory:

> Windows: %APPDATA%\Peercoin\

> OSX: $HOME/Library/Application Support/PPCoin/

>Linux: $HOME/.peercoin/

To use `peercoind` and `peercoin-cli`, you will need to add a RPC password to your peercoin.conf file. Both programs will read from the same file if both run on the same system as the same user, so any long random password will work:

> rpcpassword=change_this_to_a_long_random_password

You should also make the peercoin.conf file only readable to its owner.
On Linux, Mac OSX, and other Unix-like systems, this can be accomplished by running the following command in the Peercoin application directory:

> chmod 0600 peercoin.conf

## Peercoin Core Wallet

### Windows Installation

To install on Windows, you can find the download files here: https://www.peercoin.net/wallet.html.  Once download is complete, extract the contents of the folder.  Depending on if your system is x32 or x64 bits, choosing the relevant folder.  Run the peercoin-win_setup.exe and you will be guided through the installation process.  Once finishes, the client can be launched by running "peercoin-qt.exe" from the appropriate folder.

### Mac Installation

To install for MacOS, you can find the download files here: https://www-peercoin.net/wallet.html.  Once the download is complete, extract the contents of the folder.  Inside the extracted folder, double click the "Peercoin-Qt.dmg" file to open the client.

### Debian Installation

As of April 2018, Peercoin has official Debian repository hosted at https://peercoin.github.io/deb-repo/.
Repository is serving .deb packages for latest Debian stable, for amd64, arm64 and armhf hardware architectures.

#### Adding the GPG key

`wget -O - https://peercoin.github.io/deb-repo/peercoin.apt.key | sudo apt-key add -`

#### Adding the repository in the sources

`sudo sh -c "echo 'deb https://peercoin.github.io/deb-repo/ buster main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/peercoin.list"`

`sudo apt update`

#### Installing the packages

`sudo apt install peercoin-qt`

## General Notes

### Wallet Encryption

When a wallet is first generated, it will be unencrypted.  In order to encryt the wallet, one must go to Settings > Encrypt Wallet.  The client will then prompt the user for a password which will then be used to verify transactions and unlock the wallet for minting in the future.  It is important to make sure this password is remembered as losing access means losing access to any coins held in that wallet.  A wallet must be encrypted in order to participate in minting.

### Backups

It is strongly recommended that a backup of the wallet.dat is made and kept in a separate location in the event of hardware failure or similar disaster.  Choosing File > Backup Wallet, will present the user with the option of where to export this file.

## Wallet Overview

From this tab you can see the "Available", "Pending", and "Total" balance of your Peercoin wallet.  On the right side, you can see your "Recent transactions" as well which will show the most recent transactions that have come into the wallet recently.

### Send

The send tab is used to send Peercoin.  The "Pay To" section is where a target address can be entered.  If you wish to label the address for future use, such as an exchange, you may add it to your address book.  Amount determines the quantity of Peercoin which will be sent in the transaction.  If the wallet is encrypted, the secure password must be entered before the send transaction can be finalized.

### Receive

The Receive tab lists all wallet addresses attached to the Peercoin client.  Generating a new address is as simple as clicking the "New Address" button at the bottom of the screen.  The "Sign Message" button can also be used to verify ownership of a wallet.  [There is a tutorial on signing messages with the Peercoin client here. The example addresses have been removed from the image for privacy sake.

### Transactions

The Transactions tab gives a full history of recent transactions that have come in and out of the wallet since its creation.  It will list the Date, Type, Address, and Amount.  This information can be exported as a .csv using the "Export" button on the bottom right of the screen.  The amounts have been removed from the image for privacy sake.

### Minting

The Minting tab is the fifth option and from here, you can see the coin age of your transaction.  The Address, Age, Balance, CoinDay, and MintProbability, are also displayed.  Until the transaction reaches 30 days of age, it will be displayed in red, with a CoinDay of 0.  In the picture above, you can see a transaction that is red and is not eligible for staking due to it only having a an Age of 49.  In the next 30 days, it has a probability of minting of roughly 54.94%.  In 4 days, that transaction will become eligible for minting and change to green color.  You can use the "Display minting probability within:" drop-down menu to estimate the probability of minting during the next period.  Once the 30 day period has passed, and the transaction has become eligible for minting, go to Settings > Decrypt Wallet for Minting Only, and enter your wallet password.  If you have not already encrypted your wallet, you will be asked to do so.  Once the wallet has been unlocked for minting, leaving it running will allow for minting to occur.  Making a transaction from that wallet will disrupt the coin age and the maturation process will have to be repeated.  Sending more coins will not disrupt the coin age.

If you are interested in calculating the rough time until minting takes place, you can use this calculator: http://poscalculator.peercointalk.org/

Once minting occurs, the initial batch of coins will have their coin age reset, and the coins earned from minting will remain locked for 520 blocks, or roughly 3 days.  After this period, the coins will be available in the wallet.  As a note, you do not need to leave your wallet running 24/7, as the time spent staking does not increase the probability of minting taking place, as the highest coin age will always take precedence.  Holding longer also does not increase the minting reward.

### Addresses

Addresses is the final tab and displays the addresses saved to the Address Book from the Send tab.  This is handy for managing repeat use addresses such as exchanges.  The example address has been removed from the image for privacy sake.

## Creating a New Address

Creating a new address is very simple.  Navigate to the "Receive" tab and select the "New Address" button.  A window with a "Label" and "Address" field will appear.  Enter the name you want in the "Label" field.  You will be able to change this later.  Leave the "Address" field blank.  Click "Ok" to continue.  If you have already encrypted your wallet, you will need to enter your wallet password.

You can see the new address now available.  If you want to change the name of the label of the address, double click the name and you will be able to enter a new one.

## Sending Peercoin

If you want to send Peercoin, navigate to the "Send" tab.  We are going to send some Peercoins to the address we created above.  This page has three fields: "Pay To", "Label", and "Amount".  Paste the address you want to send Peercoins to into the "Pay To" field.  Make sure to verify that this address is correct.  If you already have a label for this wallet, it will automatically fill in the "Label" field.  If not, you can write your own in and it will be saved in your address book (Under the "Address" tab).  In the amount field, insert the number of Peercoins you would like to send.  There is a drop down menu which allows you to determine if you want to send in denominations of "Peercoins", "MilliPeercoins", "MicroPeercoins".  Make sure that you have enough to pay for the transaction fee.  When everything is finalized, press the "Send" button to confirm the transaction.  You will be prompted to confirm the transaction and must enter your wallet password to verify the transaction.  Once this is completed, you can view the transaction under the "Transactions" tab.
