# JSON-RPC API reference

Peercoin daemon offers JSON-RPC interface which can be used to control the daemon or integrate it with software stack.
You can send commands to the daemon by using `peercoin-cli` tool.

There are two official wrappers for this interface, a PHP one and a Python2.7+ one.

> Peercoin_rpc is a simple and minimal library made for communication with peercoind via JSON-RPC protocol. It has a single dependency - a Python requests library and it supports both mainnet and testnet peercoin network with authentication or SSL encryption. There is a single class to be imported from the library - Client.

> peercoin-php-rpc is a simple and minimal library made for communication with peercoind via JSON-RPC protocol for PHP 7.1+. Easiest way to use is to use composer. Otherwise include RpcClient class in your project an you are good to go.

| `getblockcount`    |             |Returns the number of blocks in the longest block chain.|no|
| `getblockhash`     |`block_num`  |Returns hash of block in best-block-chain at `block_num`; 0 is the genesis block|no|
| `gettransaction`   | `txid`        |Returns an object about the given transaction containing:<br/>  "amount" : total amount of the transaction<br/>"confirmations" : number of confirmations of the transaction<br/>"txid" : the transaction ID<br/>"time" : time associated with the transaction|no|
| `walletpassphrase` | `passphrase`   `timeout` |Stores the wallet decryption key in memory for `timeout` seconds.|no|

| `importprivkey`|  `privkey` [label] [rescan=true]|Adds a private key (as returned by dumpprivkey) to your wallet. This may take a while, as a rescan is done, looking for existing transactions.|yes|
| `createrawtransaction`| [{"txid":txid,"vout":n},...] {address:amount,...} |Creates a raw transaction spending given inputs.|no|
