# Frequently Asked Questions

## How old is the Peercoin project?

Peercoin's chain started on August 19th, 2012 at 18:00:00 UTC. There was no premine and the launch of the project was announced nine days before it went live.  You can read the original announcement thread here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=101820.0

## How can I mine Peercoin?

Peercoin uses the SHA256 cryptographic hash function. Any hardware that can effectively mine Bitcoin can be used to mine Peercoin.

## Why a 1% minting return on staking?  Why isn't there a hard limit on the total number of Peercoin's? Doesn't this disqualify Peercoin as a deflationary currency?

Peercoin has a 1% inflation rate to allow for participant determined growth over time. Fully deflationary currencies cannot be used as mediums of exchange, but rather solely stores of value. By allowing for a manageable inflation rate, Peercoin remains scarce while allowing for growth determined by participation. This also helps offset coins that are removed from circulation through lost wallets or malevolent destruction.

## Why a fixed transaction fee?

Peercoin's fixed transaction fee filters out spam transactions which have damaged chains like Bitcoin. It also allows for predictable sending fees, which may become rapidly unpredictable on chains where fees can rapidly change leaving transactions in limbo for several days. This allows for first come, first serve transactions as well. Peercoin is able to scale without worrying about valuation effecting the usability.  In version 0.7, the transaction fee is being lowered from 0.01 Peercoin to 0.001 Peercoin.

## How can the Peercoin network survive without miners providing PoW security, especially during times of low interest?

Proof of work serves to distribute coins through as an inflationary mechanism. The Peercoin network is secured by coin age and Proof-of-Stake.  With pure proof of work chains, holders have little ability to secure the chain with the high cost of mining equipment being a barrier to entry. Any Peercoin holder can protect their investment by allowing a transaction to mature and leaving the wallet open for minting keeps the network secure and has done so since Peercoin's inception.

## I just moved Peercoins to my wallet and it says I have a zero percent chance of minting in the next 30 days.  Why is that?

Peercoin transactions must mature 30 days or roughly 4320 blocks before they can become eligible for minting. This number is updated roughly every six hours. Once the 30 day period passes, your coins will become eligible and the minting probability should adjust accordingly.

## How many confirmations are required on the Peercoin network for a transaction?

Six confirmations for a transaction to be verified. Each block takes about 10 minutes.

## I just minted some coins but it says they are unavailable at the moment.  Why is that?

Once a transaction mints, it takes 520 confirmations before these become unlocked. This is done to prevent spoofed minting. Each block on the Peercoin network takes about 10 minutes and so it takes 5,200 minutes or around 3.6 days for the minted coins to become available.

## What are Checkpoints?

Checkpoints are chosen block heights for which the checksum is saved the Peercoin client. With the help of checkpoints, your client is able to identify if it has downloaded the correct blockchain or if an attacker attempts to provide it with a chain featuring "fake history".

> As of version 0.10 support for centrally-broadcasted checkpoints has been removed from the official Peercoin client.

## What are Deep chain reorganizations?

> If a single miner has more resources than the entirety of the rest of the network, this miner could pick an arbitrary previous block from which to extend an alternative block history, eventually outpacing the block history produced by the rest of the network and defining a new canonical transaction history.

This is called a “chain reorganization,” or “reorg” for short. All reorgs have a “depth,” which is the number of blocks that were replaced, and a “length,” which is the number of new blocks that did the replacing.

Deep reorganizations of the blockchain can be result of an attack on the network, whether it's PoS or PoW network. Just about 15h before this article is written there was an attack on Ethereum-Classic (a PoW network) which resulted in rollback of some 100 blocks and multiple double-spend attempts.

Checkpoints serve to protect the history of the blockchain and prevent deep chain reorganization. Most of public blockchains use checkpoints, usually in the form of a "hardened checkpoints" which are hard-coded in the source code of the client. No blockchain reorganization is allowed deeper than the last known checkpoints.

## What is Nothing-at-Stake?

Deep chain reorganizations are theoretically easier to accomplish on a Proof-of-Stake system as an attacker can fabricate the history "for free", this is commonly referred to as Nothing-at-Stake attack and is probably the most criticized element of all the Proof-of-Stake systems.

As of time of the writing Peercoin uses both centrally broadcast checkpoints which are signed with the developer's private key and hardened checkpoints encoded in the client itself.
Alternative public PoS blockchains have approached the matter in somewhat different manner, like NXT and it's 720 block anti-rollback protection, Decred with PoW based timestamping<sup>[1](#footnote-1)</sup> and few alternative proposals like checkpointing against the Bitcoin network by periodically etching messages into the Bitcoin blockchain.

We are confident that the Nothing-at-stake attack is orders of magnitude less likely to occur then it's usually portrayed in the mainstream "blockchain" media.
It's incredibly expensive to construct and organize the attack.

## Why is Peercoin still keeping the checkpoints?

> Checkpoints system is probably the most criticized design choice of Peercoin, frequently used to undermine the project.

> Common myth is that Peercoin concesus is not safe without the centralized checkpoints, but that is absolutely not true.

As of version 0.2, centrally-broadcasted checkpointing is no longer a critical part of the protocol.
It's purpose is to defend the network during the initial growth period, and to help ensure a smooth upgrade path, however it was largely kept because of inertia and low interest for the Peercoin blockchain in period between early 2015 and late 2016. The checkpoints exist solely as a security measure: if something terrible were to happen, we have the checkpoints as a backup.

As of version 0.6 the official client allows for opting-out of the checkpoints entirely, while checkpoint system itself will likely be obsoleted and removed after the process of re-basing Peercoin against modern Bitcoin-core codebase is complete.

> As of version 0.10 support for centrally-broadcasted checkpoints has been removed from the official Peercoin client.
